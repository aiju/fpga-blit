FPGA Blit
===========

This is an FPGA implementation of the Blit terminal (the original 68K version, not the DMD5620).
It's only meant to be "software-compatible" and not an accurate reproduction of the original hardware (which is hard without schematics).
It's based on the games/blit emulator shipped with 9front (which is itself based on reverse-engineering the register locations by reading the Blit source code in the V8 release).
